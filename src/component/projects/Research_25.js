                        The COVID-19 pandemic has been a significant stressor for the Canadian workforce and businesses.
                        Recent studies revealed that there are limited harmonized and evidence- informed tools, guidelines,
                        and resources to support Canadianâ€™s organizations in protecting the physical
                        and mental health of their workforce during public health crises. The focus of this project is
                        to reduce the impact of COVID-19 on the Canadian workforce and support the sustainability
                        of Canadian businesses through cultivating a community of practice between key stakeholders.

                        The CFI infrastructure includes an interactive communication system to collaborate and engage
                        with a nation-wide audience of researchers, policy makers, employers, employees, unions,
                        professional associations, and other end-users, to develop, evaluate, and disseminate research.
                        The CFI infrastructure will enable us to foster a community of practice to conduct
                        and transfer knowledge from several research projects spearheaded by the Canadian Institute
                        for Safety, Wellness, & Performance (CISWP) and Conestoga College.
