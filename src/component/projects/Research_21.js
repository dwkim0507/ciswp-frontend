                        The prevention and management of work disability is a significant challenge for paramedic services.
                        It also has an impact beyond the workplace â€“ affecting individuals outside of work, families,
                        and communities. As a result, development of paramedic health and wellness standards is listed
                        as a priority in the Paramedics Association of Canada (PAC) 2016-2018 Strategic Plan.

                     <p>
                        Work disability prevention and management is often dealt with reactively and differently
                        in each paramedic organization. Since work disability prevention and management is not integrated
                        within management systems, and not systematized across the paramedic community,
                        it can be very resource intensive and not as effective as it could be. Therefore,
                        developing an evidence-informed and unified/standardized approach will fill a critical gap.
                        It will enable the collection of consistent data for continuous improvement and ongoing/future research.
                        In addition, the Standard has the potential and capacity to address a wide range of disabilities,
                        including physical disabilities such as those caused by musculoskeletal disorders.
