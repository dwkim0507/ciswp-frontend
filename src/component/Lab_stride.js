               There is a significant need to support underrepresented groups
               by removing workplace barriers including the design of tools
               and PPE to ensure safety without compromising function.
               Current anthropometric data (physical measures of a personâ€™s size,
               form, and functional capacities) used for the design of tools and
               PPE products are often outdated, are based on non-Canadian populations,
               and generally do not consider multiple body measurement parameters, age, sex,
               race/ethnicity, or occupational composition. Anthropometric databases are
               vital for product manufacturers, particularly of those serving the emerging
               diverse Canadian skilled trades workforce.
               CISWP is positioned to be a leader in developing sector specific anthropometric
               databases and supported by state-of-the art technology, only of its kind in Canada.
