               <h3>Marcus Yung, PhD, CPE</h3>
               <h5>Associate director, Research Development and Operations</h5>

               <p>Dr. Yung is the associate director, research development and operations at the Canadian Institute for
                  Safety, Wellness & Performance (CISWP). He has expertise in human factors and ergonomics
                  across multiple sectors, including construction and manufacturing in both Canada
                  and the United States. Dr. Yungâ€™s research focuses on the etiology of work-related
                  musculoskeletal disorders, exposure assessment, and development of prevention strategies
                  and interventions to mitigate injury risk. He has expertise in individual-level measurement
                  using biomechanical and biophysical tools for both laboratory work simulations and field studies.
                  Additionally, Dr. Yung has knowledge in physical exposure estimation using population-level data
                  to construct job exposure matrices that can be used to better understand exposure-disease relationships.
                  His work also includes developing and evaluating risk assessment tools, guidelines,
                  and occupational health standards to prevent musculoskeletal injury risks and improve work performance.</p>


               <p>Prior to joining CISWP, he completed his post-doctoral training at the Canadian Centre for
                  Health & Safety in Agriculture (University of Saskatchewan) as a recipient of a Saskatchewan
                  Health Research Foundation Postdoctoral Fellowship. He was also a post-doctoral research associate
                  at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, Missouri, within the Division of
                  General Medical Sciences. Dr. Yung is a Board-Certified Professional Ergonomist (CPE).</p>
