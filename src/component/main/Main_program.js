                        <p>Knowledge transfer and exchange (KTE) is vital for applying research knowledge into practice
                           and decision-making. With immense resources invested into research,
                           the knowledge generated should be readily accessible, available and applicable
                           to knowledge users to use in practice, planning and policy-making.
                           Through ongoing collaboration with stakeholders in all stages of our applied research,
                           including conceptualization, development, execution and reporting,
                           our KTE strategies fulfill the identified needs of knowledge users.
