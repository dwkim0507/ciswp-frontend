               Work and health research conventionally lack ecological validity,
               where studies do not often use worker participants who are representative of
               potential end-users and do not take place or consider actual work environments
               and conditions. Research conducted with a convenience study sample and away
               from worksites, unfortunately, is not easily transferrable to real work settings.
               Skilled trades jobs are often complex, peripatetic, and involves irregular
               work periods; work environments are often unstructured and unpredictable;
               and work tasks are highly variable and dynamic.
               Field equipment enables both ecologically valid research but also contributes
               to CISWP’s innovative and scientifically rigorous field-to-lab-to-field approach,
               combining the control and reliability of laboratory research with the realism
               and ecological validity of the field.
